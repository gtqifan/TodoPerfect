## User Requirement

### Software Interfaces

		**Kotlin**
		Kotlin
		Version 1.6.0
		The system must use Kotlin as the programming language because it is the official language for Android applications and highly compatible with a series of Java frameworks and libraries, making testing easier. Also, it is relatively easy to adopt Kotlin and the development process is relatively easy and fast. 
	
		**Android Studio**
		Android Studio
		Version 4.2.2
		The system must use Android Studio for Android application development. It is the official IDE for Android applications, integrating multiple tools for function development and compatibility testing. In this project, Android Studio would provide functionalities of UI design, function development, and compatibility testing.

		**Amazon Web Services**
		AWS
		Latest Version
		NoSQL DynamoDB Database & Amazon Cognito
		The system must use AWS for user management and task data storage. AWS will provide cloud storage and a series API for the Android application to add, modify, or delete user profiles, or retrieve tasks information from the NoSQL DynamoDB database. Amazon Cognito would verify if the user-entered email address is usable by sending verification code to the email address.

		**JUnit**
		JUnit
		Version 4.12
		The system can use JUnit for automated unit testing. Although the application and backend logic can be tested manually, automated testing with JUnit is fast and more reliable. In the application development process, we can easily identify where the code goes wrong and immediately fix the problem. In this project, JUnit is utilized in both frontend and backend testing. For frontend, button press and a series of user interactions are tested, and for backend, adding, modifying, and deleting tasks are tested.
