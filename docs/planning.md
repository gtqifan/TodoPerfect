# Planning

## Project Lifecycle

We are Using Waterfall Lifecycle for this project, since the domain and technologies are well known, and the requirements are well defined and unlikely to change during the development phase.

## Communication

Weekly Progress report in Groupme, in-person meetings will be notified 1-2 days beforehand.

## Risk Identification

|  Risk                                | Probability | Severity | Description                                                   |
|--------------------------------------|-------------|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Work not completed on desired sprint | High        | High     | Carry unfinished work into next sprint and cycled on          |
| Integration Difficulties             | High        | Medium   | Having difficulties integrating individual components         |
| Scheduled meetings                   | Medium      | Low      | Finding appropriate time for everyone to attend group meeting |
| Cloud computing cost                 | Low         | Low      | Having trouble maintain cloud computing                       |

## Mitigation Plan

Having regular progress reports and discussions in group chats, so everyone has an idea about others’ progress and difficulties; moreover, team should improvise on sprint tasks; for instance, if one set of tasks is too much for one sprint, we will divide it into 2 or more smaller tasks for the next sprints.

## Milestones

Ideal sprints: General Structure-> Oct 24th; Individual Tasks and Components-> Nov 7th; Integration-> Nov 21st; Testing-> Nov 29th

## Tracking and Control

Progress will be reported and reviewed weekly, and any obstacles and difficulties should be mentioned and discussed, and we will compare the progress with sprint goals in order to identify lags and prepare for the next sprint as well.
