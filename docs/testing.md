# Testing

## Quality Control

### Test Plan Quality

Before we started to test our application, especially for the backend API of the user management system and the task database hosted on AWS, a set of test samples of input data was prepared. we had a fixed set of input to make sure the change of behavior is affected by only the selected subset of input data. For example, we conducted a series of unit tests, adding multiple users to the database first, editing user profiles, entering wrong email verification code, and finally deleting users and non-existing user profiles from the database. We also ran a similar test to the task database. Moreover, we had a large size of testing samples to make sure it was a good test plan and every function in the system has been tested.

Also, we performed both white-box test and black-box test on each other's parts. Everyone tests his own part first, then we switch our role: people who are responsible for the frontend will test the functionality of backend RESTful APIs, and vice versa.

### Adequacy Criterion

Since the user management system is relatively predictable, in other words the same input will always result in exactly the same output, we can simply write several test cases and compare them to our predicted output. If there exists any variation between two outputs or any error occurs, then the test is not passed and we have to modify our code. If all tests are passed, the testing is done and now we have a stable and working module. 

Apart from that, we used general checks through the process to ensure the functionality of our product. We determine that our product is working and finish our testing process once all unit tests pass and the test for the entire functionality also passes. 

### Bug Tracking

We have tracking techniques for our testing samples by keeping records of our modification in the database. We used a helper function that can return all entries in the database, which makes the debugging process easier. Everytime after we modified the database, we would ask the database to return all entries and check if the previous step executed successfully. If a bug appeared, then we would use the unit tests designed for this specific module to reveal the problem and fix it. 

For tracking the progress of tests, we utilized the “projects” function in the Github repository, where we can see each person’s responsibility in the testing process.

## Test Strategy

### Testing Process

We performed both black box and white box tests. In our testing process, team members write their own parts, test their own parts, and test other’s parts. We did unit tests focusing on single functions (login, signup, places search) first. Then we ran unit tests focusing on the general login system and the general place search system which are more complex compared to individual modules in the unit tests. Finally, after all subunit test cases passed, we ran tests on the entire system, simulating a user interacting with our web application from signup to login and to place search. This is commonly known as the bottom-up testing approach.

### Technology

We utilized JUnit for testing both frontend and backend cases.
